binary

A binary puzzle solver.

Binary puzzles (also known as binary sudoku) usually consist of a grid of 12*12.
These dimensions can differ per puzzle.

The grid will contain only 0's and 1's. Some of the 0's and 1's are already given,
so you don't have to start from scratch.

The rules for filling in the missing 0's and 1's are as follows:
- The twin rule:
  No more than two 0's or two 1's may be found next to each other. This means that
  1001 is OK, but 10001 is not OK. The same goes for 0110 (OK) and 01110 (not OK).
- The balance rule:
  An equal amount of 0's and 1's must be on each line and each column.
  For a grid of 12*12 this means that 6 zeros and 6 ones must be on each line.
- The unique rule:
  No two lines (or columns) may be the same. Each line must be unique.

The goal of this program is not to solve all my binary puzzles so I don't have to.
The goal is to deepen my understanding of the puzzle by translating my solving
skills to algorithms the computer will understand. This means that I first must
understand how I solve a puzzle, and then make the computer understand how to do it.
So this is a test of my knowledge of the binary puzzles and my understanding of the
programming language of my choice (C).
